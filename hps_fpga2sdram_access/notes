Quartus Firmware
  - Version 2019.1 Lite Edition

Building Bootloader: Cyclone V SoC - Boot from SD Card
  - See https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/Documentation/BuildingBootloader
  - My u-boot-socfgpa branch: origin/socfpga_v2020.07 (older branches will not create correct files to set up FPGA2SDRAM interface)
  - Copy your u-boot-with-spl.sfp to ./sd_card/

Building Linux: Building Linux Kernel
  - See https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/Documentation/BuildingBootloader
  - My linux-socfpga branch: origin/socfpga-5.4.44-lts
  - I made a couple config changes to add USB camera support for my PS3 Eye in menuconfig (stay tuned for a future project)
      |- Device Drivers->Multimedia support <Y>
      |- Device Drivers->Multimedia support->Cameras/video grabbers support <Y>
      |- Device Drivers->Multimedia support->Media USB Adapters <Y>
      |- Device Drivers->Multimedia support->Media USB Adapters->UVC input events device support <Y>
      |- Device Drivers->Multimedia support->Media USB Adapters->GSPCA based webcams->OV534 OV722x USB Camera Driver <Y>
      |- Device Drivers->Multimedia support->Media USB Adapters->GSPCA based webcams->OV534 OV965x USB Camera Driver <Y>
  - You can take the zImage and device tree blob. If you are using the dmabuffer driver, make sure to decompile the dtb add the node for
    the platform probe and recompile before making the SD card image

Building the Root Filesystem: Building Yocto Rootfs
  - See https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/Documentation/BuildingBootloader
  - In addition to listed steps in the guide, for SFTP and SSH support, at the bottom of <meta-altera-dir>/build/conf/local.conf, add 
     |- IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " usbutils openssh-scp openssh-sftp-server openssh-ssh openssh"
  - All other build steps are same as in guide (some steps below are duplicate)
  - After build, under sd_card directory 
      |- $: mkdir rootfs && cd rootfs
      |- $: sudo tar xf <meta-altera-dir>/build/tmp/deploy/images/cyclone5/core-image-minimal-cyclone5.tar.gz .
      |- $: sudo rm -rf lib/modules/*
      |- $: sudo cp <linux-checkout-dir>/a9/modules/* ./lib/modules
   - Now that sd_card/rootfs is setup, you are ready to run the sd_call.sh script
